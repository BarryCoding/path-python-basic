# Python Basic Path

## RPG 

Write a text-based role-playing game (RPG) with the following characteristics:
- There’s one player and one monster
- The player starts with 100 health, the monster with 150 health (it’s big!)
- The player can choose to attack, heal, or run away.
- If the player attack, the player deal between 10- 15 damage to the monster.
- If the player heal, the player regain 30 health, up to a maximum of 100.
- If the player run away, the game ends.
- After the player’s turn, if the monster is still alive, it deals 15- 20 damage to the player.

The game continues until either the player or the monster’s health reaches 0, or
the player runs away.

Stretch Goals:
- Prevent the player from exiting the game by pressing Ctrl + C.
- Introduce double-damage critical hits that happen when an attack value is a factor of 3.
- Use emojis or string formatting syntax to make the game output more fun.
